      "You are a rebel spy who has snuck aboard the Death Star in search of "
      "intel on Darth Vader's next attack. You are sure that you'll be able "
      "to take this information back to the Rebel Alliance and help destroy "
      "the Sith, who are rising to power in their creation of the Galactic Empire."
      "As you're sneaking through the corridors of the massive space-station, the "
      "alarm sounds. You duck into a dark corner just outside the control room as dozens of "
      "storm-troopers run toward the main entrance of the ship. Now is your chance! You take this "
      "opportunity to race into the empty control room, and gather the intel you need."
      "The Death Star is under attack, and now that you have what you came for, it's "
      "time to find a strategic escape!")
